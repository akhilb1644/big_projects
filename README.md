# big_projects

The purpose of this repository is for projects that I deem important. One of the projects I did was the monopoly game using basic user input. The monopoly folder is there because I wanted to figure out a way to put monopoly on the computer(on my own) with minimal effort. Hence, the monopoly folder. By the way, always play with a bag of your favorite snack while playing this because monopoly, in case you don't know, is a really looooooooooong game.

I also have simulations and Artificial Intelligence algorithms. One of my artificial intelligence algorithms is based on historical data of the USA, and it ended up being an alternate history where America increases tariffs and Millenials are living like baby boomers(we all know that is a false statement). Accordingly, I am working on a new artificial intelligence model that will take a deeper look into American Historical Data and predict modern America with much more accuracy.
