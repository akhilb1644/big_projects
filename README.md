# big_projects

The purpose of this repository is for projects that I deem important. One of the projects I did was the monopoly game using basic user input. The monopoly folder is there because I wanted to figure out a way to put monopoly on the computer(on my own) with minimal effort. Hence, the monopoly folder. By the way, always play with a bag of your favorite snack while playing this because monopoly, in case you don't know, is a really looooooooooong game.

I also have simulations, and I will soon be putting more simulations soon.
