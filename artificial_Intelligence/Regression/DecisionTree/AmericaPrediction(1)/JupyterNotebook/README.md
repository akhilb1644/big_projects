<h3 align="center">Original Data</h3>
<p>In this directory, using Jupyter Notebook to create an AI(Artificial Intelligence) model, I predicted that America, with high tariffs, will have its working 
generation live like the Baby Boomers(or Homer Simpson) But first, one needs to look at the dataset I trained the model on, and I have it on a graph to see.</p>

<h6 align="center">Fertility Rates and Debt</h6>

<p>As we can see, the 1920s saw the decline in birth rates, which is the decline in "standard of living"(THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO MATERIAL STANDARD OF LIVING)
when accounting for change in ideology and whether the economic system is sustainable(as we can see, the 1920s wasn't sustainable economics). Also, with 
fertility rates, a change in ideology shows a change in society, which is reflected through fertility rates, like how the baby boomers were different from
their parents in terms of ideology and they had a lot less children than their parents. Their ideology was less connected to god and more connected to just
chilling and dowing whatever you felt like. There wasn't honour. Take the Vietnam war: the Baby Boomers didn't feel like they had to support the war because
they didn't have to go beyond what their ancestors did. This is one reason why the Vietnam War wasn't a popular war(another one is linked to television, or
maybe television led to an ideological shift for the Baby Boomers). Back to debt, I just want to say that one can't have kids and then pay for the extra kid 
with the debt(some people might, who knows), but for the most part, debt is usually to help sustain their life in hard times, or maybe bathe in luxuries during
hard times(depends on who you are or how "hard" the times were, but most people decide not to have another child when they have to be funded with debt.
While the residence you and your children live in is paid with debt, and the costs of food might be funded with debt, that doesn't mean that you will
have another child because you can take out debt. Anyway, I would like to move on to inflation.</p>
