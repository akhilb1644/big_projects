<p align="center">America has increased tariffs on foreign products and is in another golden age today(except that its not).</p>

<p3>  Today, America finds itself in a crazy world. There are open protests in the country, people aren't marrying young(its a sign that there is a 
  problem in society), and people aren't having many children relative to the population(its also a sign that there is a problem in society). I know
  someone will talk about the material improvements in standard of living, but the birth rate itself can say a lot. The birth rate can tell whether
  the population is experiencing hardship, which is characterized by a significant decrease in birth rate. I'll give an example: a village in the middle
  of the US has had a high birth rate due to the high religiousness and commonality of a certain religion, everyone knew eachother very well, and it was 
  not hard to settle in life, being the main factor in a high birth rate in addition to religion. However, the nearby city then expanded and they were
  exposed to the hardships and stresses of the modern world, along with the material advantages, like an iPhone. This then leads to the decline of the
  birth rates. This is just a hypothetical example, but you can look at the UK's birth rates and see when industrialization and WWI happened, which
  happened when there was a decrease in birth rates. While I have more work to do to make a true predictor for America's future, I believe that I am not
  too far away to do so.</p3>

<p3>  Now on to tariffs. I would say that tariffs lead to nice short term gains, which is why I am using tariffs in my data. However, I would not say that
  a society can be protectionist forever as that would forego technological advancement if done for a long enough time, and I would not say that free trade
  forever isn't good as it depresses the wages of many for the country that has a trade deficit, which is very easy in our modern world. I would also say
  that tariffs come when a society feels uncompetitive, like what happened in many European countries during the Long Depression and the Hawley-Smoot Tariff
  in the United States. You can even trace this back to the 1600s when mercantilism began to rise(I would say that part of this could be because of Spain's
  trade power in the early 1500s) in some way. But overall, the general trend still stands: when there is more competition, people want to get rid of the
  competition</p3>
