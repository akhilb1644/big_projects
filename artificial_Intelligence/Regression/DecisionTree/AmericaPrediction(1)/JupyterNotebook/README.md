<p3>  Today, America finds itself in a crazy world. There are open protests in the country, people aren't marrying young(its a sign that there is a 
  problem in society), and people aren't having many children relative to the population(its also a sign that there is a problem in society). I know
  someone will talk about the material improvements in standard of living, but the birth rate itself can say a lot. The birth rate can tell whether
  the population is experiencing hardship, which is characterized by a significant decrease in birth rate. I'll give an example: a village in the middle
  of the US has had a high birth rate due to the high religiousness and commonality of a certain religion, everyone knew eachother very well, and it was 
  not hard to settle in life, being the main factor in a high birth rate in addition to religion. However, the nearby city then expanded and they were
  exposed to the hardships and stresses of the modern world, along with the material advantages, like an iPhone. This then leads to the decline of the
  birth rates. This is just a hypothetical example, but you can look at the UK's birth rates and see when industrialization and WWI happened, which
  happened when there was a decrease in birth rates. While I have more work to do to make a true predictor for America's future, I believe that I am not
  too far away to do so.</p3>
