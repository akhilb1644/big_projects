<h3 align="center">Original Data</h3>
<p>In this directory, using Jupyter Notebook to create an AI(Artificial Intelligence) model, I predicted that America, with high tariffs, will have its working 
generation live like the Baby Boomers(or Homer Simpson) But first, one needs to look at the dataset I trained the model on, and I have it on a graph to see.</p>

<h6 align="center">Fertility Rates and Debt</h6>

<p>As we can see, the 1920s saw the decline in birth rates, which is the decline in "standard of living"(THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO MATERIAL STANDARD OF LIVING)
when accounting for change in ideology and whether the economic system is sustainable(as we can see, the 1920s wasn't sustainable economics). Also, with 
fertility rates, a change in ideology shows a change in society, which is reflected through fertility rates, like how the baby boomers were different from
their parents in terms of ideology and they had a lot less children than their parents. Their ideology was less connected to god and more connected to just
chilling and doing whatever you felt like. There wasn't honour. Take the Vietnam war: the Baby Boomers didn't feel like they had to support the war because
they didn't have to go beyond what their ancestors did. This is one reason why the Vietnam War wasn't a popular war(another one is linked to television, or
maybe television led to an ideological shift for the Baby Boomers). Also, humans are naturally animals, and so we would have to spread our genes, unless our
new ideology justifies us for not having children, but for the most part, preserving the "group's genes" is important for the survival of the group(maybe that
is why the birth rate fell with baby boomers, they were the first generation who didn't have to care a whole lot about the survival of their group). Back to debt,
I just want to say that one can't have kids and then pay for the extra kid with the debt(some people might, who knows), but for the most part, debt is usually to help
sustain their life in hard times, or maybe bathe in luxuries during hard times(depends on who you are or how "hard" the times were, but most people decide not to have
another child when they have to be funded with debt. While the residence you and your children live in is paid with debt, and the costs of food might be funded with
debt, that doesn't mean that you will have another child because you can take out debt. Anyway, I would like to move on to inflation.</p>

<h6 align="center">Inflation</h6>

<p>Inflation, a metric that some countries just can't avoid being near the top. But more importantly, an indicator on how much energy the economy has. High inflation
is an economy with high energy, but it will eventually crash, like what happens to a kid after a "sugar rush". A low inflation economy doesn't have much energy and
is generally quite stagnant. What one should aim for is the sweet spot of around 2% annual inflation. The economy has energy, but not enough to just suddenly crash
whenever something goes wrong. Anyway, in the 1920s, the economy, for the most part, wasn't very energetic. One explaination is that during WWI, countries were 
producing so many supplies that they would be considered surplus at peacetime. However, that production carried over to the 1920s, and things were cheap(not good
news). While it meant that people could afford things easily, it also meant that there wasn't much competition to make things(sort've like there is now), but also
businesses weren't turning a profit, which hurt the economy. This is why you see the rise in tariffs in the 1920s, as it was needed to make sure the economy was doing
well despite the low inflation. Going into the Great Depression, inflation rates were below zero, which was a sign of how the economy pretty much grinded to a halt.
It was like during COVID when prices were really cheap, and companies also laid off lots of workers because of the lack of profits, which did come because of the 
lack of demand, but the Great Depression was different. Inflation was low from the beginning, and the house of cards fell when the stock market began to crash. 
Anyway, FDR saves the nation and inflation during WW2 is around 6 percent a year. Tariffs also ease as the economy is doing quite well. The inflation helped to
spur short term growth, which made America worth 1/2 the world economy at the end on World War 2. Once the 1950s came in, inflation was moderate(at the "golden"
level) and people were living fine lives. However, America was growing increasingly dependent on the outside world, and soon, inflation would kick in because
of the rapid rise in spending coupled with the expenses of the Vietnam War, which explains the rise in inflation. With America growing dependent on the outside
world due to globalization, a new crisis would come: the 1973 Recession!</p>
